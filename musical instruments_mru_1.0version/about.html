    <p>
      India has a rich tradition of classical music with a wide variety of string, wind, and percussion instruments.
      These instruments have been passed down over centuries and are deeply rooted in regional cultures and devotional practices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instruments like the <b>Veena</b>, <b>Sitar</b>, <b>Sarangi</b>, <b>Santoor</b>, and <b>Flute</b> are not only used in classical concerts
      but are also central to storytelling, folklore, and spiritual rituals. The <b>Shenoy</b> (Shehnai), for example, is often played at weddings and temple ceremonies.
    </p>

    <p>
      This chart-style project celebrates the beauty of these instruments and aims to preserve their knowledge using Bharati Script,
      so young learners and enthusiasts across India can access this cultural heritage in a unified script.
